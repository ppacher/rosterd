# rosterd

This repository contains the source code of rosterd, a simple but powerful rostering software developed for
the veterinary clinic in Dobersberg.

Work on this project is still in-progress and it's not yet feature complete (not even ready to be usable ;)).

Maybe come back later to see how to use `rosterd` to manage your duty-rosters, off-time requests and auto-generate
duty-rosters based on a list of per-employee constraints and working hours.
